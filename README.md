# local-alignment

TODO:
- [ ] add affine score for gap extensions (as per Durbin pg. 16)
- [ ] remove global and alignment portions of algorithm (remove parts concerned with `Alignment.FIT` and `Alignment.NW`)
- [ ] no traceback currently implemented (e.g. to return aligned strings computed from pointer matrcies)
